# credit-card-project

Since there was an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans in Credit One company over the past year or so,
I performed exploratory data analysis in Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to help the company to gain insight into what factors affected default rate. I also applied Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, KNN, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models to predict customer Default with impressive accuracy.

Descriptions of data sources:

There are the total 30,000 observations in our credit card dataset. The dataset used binary variable â€“ default payment next month (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. There are 6636 observations (22.12%) are customers with default payment. This dataset used 23 variables as explanatory variables.
